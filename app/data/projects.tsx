            At <strong>Authentic Family Organization Rwanda (AFOR)</strong>, we believe that strong families create strong communities. The <strong>Urukundo Nirwogere Project</strong> was born out of this belief, aiming to <strong>bring peace, love, and stability to families struggling with conflicts and domestic violence in Maraba Sector, Huye District</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mb-8">
            Through this project, we walked alongside families in crisis, helped children return to school, empowered women and men to build healthy relationships, and supported struggling households to regain economic stability.

            This project wasn't just about numbers—it was about real people, real stories, and real change. Families who once struggled with conflict now sit together in peace. Children who once roamed the streets now have a chance at a brighter future. Women and men are learning to <strong>share responsibilities, respect each other, and build homes filled with love, not fear</strong>.

          <p class="mb-6">
            But our journey isn't over. The need is still great, and <strong>AFOR remains committed to expanding this work—bringing hope, healing, and empowerment to more families across Rwanda</strong>.
          </p>
  
          <p class="text-center font-bold text-xl mb-6">
            Together, we are building something truly beautiful: <strong>authentic families, strong communities, and a future full of love.</strong>
