              Every child deserves to wake up to warmth, sleep without worry, and grow in a home where they feel safe, valued, and loved. But for too many children, this is not the reality.
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li>ðŸ’” Some children wake up in broken homes, where conflict and violence steal their laughter.</li>
              <li>ðŸ’” Some roam the streets, longing for a warm embrace, a meal, or simply someone who cares.</li>
              <li>ðŸ’” Some are forced to grow up too soon, burdened with struggles no child should ever carry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At Authentic Family Organization Rwanda (AFOR), we believe that no child should ever feel invisible, unloved, or unsafe. That's why we stand up for themâ€”rescuing, protecting, and restoring the lives of vulnerable children.
